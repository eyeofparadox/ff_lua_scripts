-- diffustion limited aggregation

-- set max tree array length equal to a percentage of width times height
-- initial seed is walker stuck at center (other initialization options worth exploring)
-- when a walker connects with tree, it becomes stuck and moves from walker array  to tree array
-- seed walkers from a radius at increasing distance from center to corner -- optionally by random angle 
-- walkers move according to random vector2d
-- seed with a random probability of appearing in any given frame -- increase radius after every sweep
-- seed walkers while tree.length is less than max tree length
-- reflect walkers that cross the seed radius back inward
-- scale walkers proportionately according to the order in which they get stuck, with a standard radius in walk mode
