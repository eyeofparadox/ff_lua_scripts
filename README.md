# **Lua for Filter Forge Map & Curve Script Components**

First attempt to push files from laptop to a repository on the GitHub server. These are Lua scripts designed for the Map Script component in Filter Forge. A couple recreate API scripts from the FF website, but most are original work by me.

## 2024/10/24 • Development Workspace Migration & Repo Update

The system hosting my original repo was wiped out by overheating some time ago. I got a new system and continued to write Lua scripts for Filter Forge, but did not have it in its own repo. I just didn't think of it until now. There is nothing official about this project; it'd just been an offshoot of my own exploration of what I could accomplish using Map and Curve Scripts.

As noted above, I started with the API scripts from the FF website. I do not have any collaborators but no one has expressed interest up to this point. This is a public repository, though, so I'm invoking a Creative Commons license for anyone making use of this content.
